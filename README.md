# Multistage_Docker_Build
Dockerfile demonstrating the use of multistage builds.It showcases how to define  multiple build stages within a single Dockerfile,each performing specific tasks such as compiling code,  installing dependencies,and packaging the final application and reduce image size by using steps in one file.

The main purpose of choosing a golang based applciation to demostrate this example is golang is a statically-typed programming language that does not require a runtime in the traditional sense. Unlike dynamically-typed languages like Python, Ruby, and JavaScript, which rely on a runtime environment to execute their code, Go compiles directly to machine code, which can then be executed directly by the operating system.

So the real advantage of multi stage docker build and distro less images can be understand with a drastic decrease in the Image size.

# Why mulstaging is required ??
Multi-stage builds are used in Docker images to optimize image size and composition. They offer benefits like:

Smaller Images: By splitting the build process into stages, you include only the necessary files in each stage. This results in a final image that contains only the runtime components, reducing unnecessary bloat.

Security: By excluding development tools and build artifacts from the final image, you reduce potential vulnerabilities. This mitigates security risks since only the runtime essentials are included.

Efficiency: Multi-stage builds streamline the image creation process. Developers can use intermediate images from earlier stages without rebuilding everything, saving time and resources.

Maintainability: The separation of build and runtime components improves the maintainability of Dockerfiles. Changes to the build stage don't impact the runtime stage, enhancing code organization.

Portability: Images produced through multi-stage builds can be easily moved between different environments since they include only what's necessary for execution.

Flexibility: Multi-stage builds can accommodate various languages, tools, and frameworks. This flexibility allows developers to tailor stages to specific application needs.

Reproducibility: Multi-stage builds help ensure consistency across different environments by using a defined set of steps for building images.

In essence, multi-stage builds enhance Docker image development, making images smaller, more secure, efficient, and maintainable.

# What are distroless images ??
Distroless images are like super lightweight containers. Imagine a container is like a box for running apps. Regular containers come with a lot of extra stuff, like a mini computer inside. But distroless containers are super tiny. They only have exactly what your app needs to work, nothing extra.

The main idea behind distroless is to keep bad guys away. By having only the essential things, it's harder for bad guys to break in. It's like having a secret door that only your app knows about.

Because distroless containers are so small, they're really fast to start and use less computer memory. They're like race cars for apps.

But remember, while distroless is great for safety and speed, it's a bit trickier to set up and fix if something goes wrong. Google made a tool called Distroless to help make these tiny containers, which is really handy.

So, distroless is like a superhero for your apps â€“ small, fast, and super strong against bad guys!
